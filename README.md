## Fibonacci Sequence Generator

# Bootstrapped with Create React App

### About

A practice React application built to capitalize on my love of Fibonacci numbers. This application allows users to enter any two numbers to initiate a Fibonacci sequence with, and select the number of iterations to run. Underneath each listed number an ever expanding line demonstrates the rapid growth of the sequence.
